# textual_adventure
This is an attempt to create a framework for textual adventures using TextualizeUI.
The story is presented through nodes, defined by the Node class. The node has a name with which you can identify it and link it with other nodes.
The nodes are linked by action words highlighted in red. Those are words that are correlated to a name of a node. The action words change the current node of the story.
The node has also some informative words highlighted in green that can be typed by the player. Those will update the information box with that keyword description.

You can edit the Css file and tags to suit your needs.
As it's built with TextualUI You can add widgets etc...
